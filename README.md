# Geometry_Zine
In preparation for ZineFest, this repository contains files for a geometry-based zine. The zine will showcase common geometric concepts, layered to create a final shapes to be used for visualization effect. The zine pages will also include the math to structure them, artistic images, quotes, and a companion JS-based code example.
